This repo contains the material provided by the project mentor. I, Arjun, 25B3928, have added in all the work I've done.

This repo contains 2 major edits from my side:

1) The Question 1 in Assignment 1 has been solved, with the code written in q1.py
2) A summary of my learnings from the project so far has been provided in the attached file "summary"


Till now, the work done in the project has been mostly studying up on theory from the CS228 lecture slides. Below is a brieflisting of everything I've learned so far, which enabled me to write the code:

1) Reading up on propositional logic
2) Basic syntax and semantics
3) Satisfiability and Validity of Formulas
4) Normal Forms - CNF and DNF forms of formulas and complexity of checking satisfiability.
5) Encoding simple constraints as clauses
6) Understanding DPLL algorithm
7) Implementing a very basic DPLL based solver in python
8) Encoding sudoku into constraints and solving it using the SAT solver.
